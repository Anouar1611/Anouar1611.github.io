   **Eclipse RCP (Eclipse Rich Client Platform)** is an Eclipse based application, we could say that RCP provides us a generic Eclipse workbench or framework that developers can use to build their applications.
So, the Eclipse IDE is just a specific Eclipse application that provides developers to have an environment for their software development. An Eclipse application consists of at least one
software component called ***plug-in*** which is extensible to be used by other plug-ins.


> ***I hope this definition was clear, now we could take a look for why we should build an Eclipse RCP application.


- Using Eclipse RCP, we can mention the extensebility will allow us to create an open platforms and we can create our own feature-rich and professional application quickly under multiple platforms as well as RCP provides us a high quality of components that are able for reuse.
